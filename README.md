# Dev Connector

Welcome to the Dev Connector Application. This is meant to be a place where developers may sign up and discuss all things tech 
and development related. Once signed up, users may create a profile to showcase their skills, past experiences and educations,
as well as any social links. 

This is first full-stack application and was certaintly the most enjoyable to build. On the backend, I use NodeJS and Express to run my server and create my routes, along with MongoDB as my database. On the front-end, I used ReactJS to display the UI, while using Redux as state management. 

Building this project, solidified my knowledege of the client-server relationship, helping me understand, which part of the code is run 
on the server, and which part is ran on the client.

Please feel free to sign up, and explore the application. I would love the oppurtuity to connect with other developers. The site can be accessed [here](https://arctic-pylon-18588.herokuapp.com/).
