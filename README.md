# Dev Connector

Welcome to the Dev Connector Application. This is meant to be a place where developers may sign up and discuss all things tech and 
and development related. Once signed up, users may create a profile to showcase their skills, past experiences and educations,
as well as as any social links. 

This is first full-stack application and was certaintly the most enjoyable to build. On the backend, I use NodeJS and express to create
my run my server and create my routes, along with MongoDB as my database. On the front-end, I used ReactJS to display the UI, while using Redux as state management. 

Building this project, solidified my knowledege of the client-server relationship, helping me understand, which part of the code is run 
on the server, and which part ran on the client.
